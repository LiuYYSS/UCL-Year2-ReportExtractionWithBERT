As an 18 year old, Fatima was already working and studying at the same time. Reminiscing her triumphs as an independent woman, she decided to take a leap of faith and challenge the status quo. Following a series of training programs in self empowerment and basic life skills at the Queen Rania Family and Child Center (QRFCC), Fatima was able to regain her self esteem, which in turn made her a better wife and mother. \"It's comforting to dwell under the shadows, never initiate. That would kill you! QRFCC was a life saver for me. I frequented the center on a daily basis, despite the burden of long distances and having my 6 month daughter with me all the time. I've managed to empower many women around me, by becoming a volunteer at and outside the center. I recall holding a session about sound parenting to a group of parents, one of the fathers later told me that session saved his marriage following years of abuse and violence against his wife and children.' www.jordanriver.jo 51 raining and Consultancy The Training and Consultancy Division (TCD) provides support to JRF programs.
